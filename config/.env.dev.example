# Example: DEV_IMAGE_NAME=gesturevision-dev:my-feature-branch
DEV_IMAGE_NAME=gesturevision-dev:${APP_VERSION:-dev}

# --- Docker Host IP ---
# REQUIRED for WebRTC ICE negotiation to work correctly.
# This should be the IP address of your Docker host machine on the LAN.
# Usually only needed if testing RTSP streams hosted *outside* the host machine's
# local network that the *container* needs to access for WebRTC ICE negotiation.
# For local RTSP streams or local webcam testing, this can often be left blank.
